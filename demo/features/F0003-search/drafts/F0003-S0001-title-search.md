# Title search

## Assignment (as of log entry 1)

Find todos by a piece of their title: `GET /todos?search=milk` returns the todos whose title contains the text, ignoring case, in creation order, and combines with the existing `done` filter. The service filters what the repository lists, as it does for `done`; no repository change, no domain change.

## Interface

`src/app/service/todo_service.py`

```python
class TodoService:
    def list(self, *, done: bool | None = None, search: str | None = None) -> list[Todo]: ...
```

- `search` is stripped, then matched as a substring of the title after Unicode case folding (`str.casefold`) of both.
- `None`, or a text that is empty after stripping, means no title filter.
- `done` and `search` combine: a todo must satisfy both. The order stays the repository's (creation order).

`src/app/api/routes.py`

```python
@router.get("")   # with the decorator arguments it has today
def list_todos(
    service: Service,
    done: bool | None = None,
    search: Annotated[str | None, Query(max_length=MAX_TITLE_LENGTH)] = None,
) -> list[TodoRead]: ...
```

- A `search` longer than `MAX_TITLE_LENGTH` (200) characters is rejected by the schema with 422, in the API's error shape.

## Acceptance criteria

1. With todos titled `Buy Milk`, `MILK run` and `Call mum`, `list(search="milk")` returns the first two, in creation order.
2. `list(search="  milk ")` returns the same todos as `list(search="milk")`.
3. `list(search="")` and `list(search="   ")` return the same todos as `list()`.
4. Case folding, not just lower case: with a todo titled `Straße`, `list(search="STRASSE")` returns it.
5. With `Buy Milk` done and `MILK run` open, `list(done=False, search="milk")` returns only `MILK run`, and `list(done=True, search="milk")` only `Buy Milk`.
6. `GET /todos?search=milk` on the data of criterion 1 returns 200 and the two matching todos, in creation order.
7. `GET /todos?done=true&search=milk` on the data of criterion 5 returns 200 and only `Buy Milk`.
8. `GET /todos?search=<201 characters>` returns 422 and a body whose only key is `detail`, a string starting with `query.search: `.
9. `GET /todos` without parameters still returns every todo.
10. `make check` stays green.
11. docs: `docs/api.md` names the `search` parameter in the endpoint table and states its rules in a sentence (stripped, case-insensitive substring, combines with `done`, empty means no filter, at most 200 characters); the README's example shows one `search` call.

## Demo

```bash
uv run python -c "
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.api.main import build_app
c = TestClient(build_app({}))
for t in ('Buy Milk', 'MILK run', 'Call mum'):
    c.post('/todos', json={'title': t})
print([t['title'] for t in c.get('/todos', params={'search': ' milk '}).json()])
r = c.get('/todos', params={'search': 'x' * 201})
print(r.status_code, list(r.json()))
"
```
Expect: `['Buy Milk', 'MILK run']`, then `422 ['detail']`.
